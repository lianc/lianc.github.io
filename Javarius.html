<p style="color:#000000;"><b>INTERVIEW WITH JAVARIUS</b></p>
<b>1.</b> Yea, but I don't get the joke.<br>
<b>2.</b> Exactly. No time or interest.<br>
<b>3.</b> Man?<br>
<b>4.</b> Ha. I'm gender non-conforming so I prefer you to address me as Javarius, Java, J, Jones, or any variant of my name. OK?<br>
<b>5.</b> Because that's what I said goddamit, and the imposition of gender binaries are destructive to human evolution. Next question.<br>
<b>6.</b> You didn't. And even if you did, but that wasn't your intent, the impact is what matters. Rememba dat.<br>
<b>7.</b> OK. I have to go now. It was nice meetin' you.<br><br>
