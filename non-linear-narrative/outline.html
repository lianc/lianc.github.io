  <body><div><h2>OUTLINE</h2>
For my project, I'd like to focus on the timeline of life and the thoughts and worries corresponding to each stage. I feel that this topic is significant to me at this current point, since I'm close to graduating and soon must "figure out" my life. So for example, a young child may have concerns regarding friends at school, an adult around age 45 may experience a midlife crisis, and at age 80 a person may only worry about his/her children and family. I will typographically and visually depict these worries.<p>Please <a href="mailto:chaol464@newschool.edu">let me know</a> if this topic sounds okay!</p>
