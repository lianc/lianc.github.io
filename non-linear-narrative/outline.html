  <body><div><h2>OUTLINE</h2>
For my project, I'm thinking of focusing on the timeline of a lifespan, and the thoughts and worries that a person has at each stage. I feel that this topic is significant to me and my life at this current point, since I'm close to graduating and must "figure out" my life. So for example, a child may have concerns regarding friends at school, an adult around age 40 or 50 may experience a midlife crisis, and at age 80 a person may only worry about his/her children and family.<p>Please <a href="mailto:chaol464@newschool.edu">let me know</a> if this topic sounds okay!</p>
