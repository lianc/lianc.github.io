<span title="Ruled by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) for more than six decades, China remains an authoritarian state, one that systematically curtails a wide range of fundamental human rights, including freedom of expression, association, assembly, and religion. The trend for human rights under President Xi Jinping continued in a decidedly negative direction.">BACKGROUND INFO</span>

<p><span title="The Chinese government tightly restricts freedom of expression through censorship and punishments. While the Internet has offered a marginally freer space, the government censors politically unacceptable information through means such as the “Great Firewall.”   Despite media censorship, journalists and editors have at times pushed the limits of acceptable expression.">FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION</span></p>

<p><span title="The government restricts religious practice to five officially recognized religions and only in officially approved religious premises. The government audits the activities, employee details, and financial records of religious bodies, and retains control over religious personnel appointments, publications, and seminary applications. One extreme case is the persecution of Falun Gong practitioners, in which millions have been affected by imprisonment, torture, and even forced organ harvesting.">FREEDOM OF RELIGION</span></p>

<p><span title="Homosexuality was decriminalized in 1997 and removed from an official list of mental illnesses in 2001. There is still no law protecting people from discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity, however, and there is no legal recognition of same-sex partnership.">GENDER IDENTITY</span></p>

<p><span title="Activists seeking to defend human rights have faced a surge in reprisals under Xi, at times enduring arbitrary detention, enforced disappearance, politicized prosecutions, and torture by authorities in response to their work.">HUMAN RIGHTS DEFENDERS</span></p>

<p><span title="While the CCP is rhetorically committed to gender equality, its lack of respect for human rights means that women continue to face systemic discrimination on issues ranging from employment to sexual harassment. Family planning policies, which control the number and spacing of children people can have, continue to impose severe restrictions on women’s reproductive freedoms.">WOMEN'S RIGHTS</span></p>

<p><span title="China ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) in 2008, but persons with disabilities continue to face barriers and discrimination, including lack of access to education.">DISABILITY RIGHTS</span></p>

<p><span title="Xinjiang, home to 10 million Uighurs, continues to be the site of pervasive discrimination, repression, and restrictions on fundamental human rights. Opposition to central and local policies has been expressed in peaceful protests, but also through violent incidents such as bombings, though details about both protests and violence are often scant as authorities keep an especially tight hold over information in Xinjiang.">XINJIANG - 新疆</span></p>

<p><span title="The 6th Tibet Work Forum meeting in late August, held to determine central government policy for the region for years to come, emphasized the imperatives of security and “stability,” but authorities failed to address systematic ethnic and religious discrimination and restrictions, or the profound socioeconomic changes brought by massive re-housing and resettlement campaigns in which Tibetans were compelled to participate.">TIBET - 西藏</span></p>

<p><span title="Although Hong Kong is guaranteed autonomy in all matters other than foreign affairs and defense, and enjoys an independent judiciary and other civil liberties, Beijing appears to be encroaching on the rights to political participation, expression, and assembly there.">HONG KONG - 香港</span></p>

<p><span title="Under the leadership of Xi Jinping, China continues to aggressively advance its territorial claims in Asia, causing particular alarm by building structures on small reefs in the South China Seas that could one day accommodate military outposts. At the Security Council, China joined Russia in May 2014 in vetoing a resolution that would have referred the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court (ICC); in December, it tried to block discussion of the human rights situation in North Korea.">FOREIGN POLICY</span></p>

<p><span title="Widespread knowledge of the atrocities and injustices against human rights in China is the first step to change. For further action, we should write to our senators and local government officials to urge them to take stand on the pressing issues regarding human rights in China.">PSA: WHAT CAN WE DO?</span></p>
