<b>1.</b> <font color="#AF7AC5">What is your dream job and why?</font><br><i>My dream job is to able to apply different fields of design such as graphic design, fashion, and photography into my work and to communicate with clients on an international scale.</i>
<br><br>
<b>2.</b> <font color="#AF7AC5">Did you always know you wanted to major in a design related field or how did you discover you wanted to?</font>
<br><i>I have always loved design in all of its contexts, whether it be graphic design, fashion, or architecture. I chose Communications Design because I felt like I could explore a broader range of design aspects through this major.</i><br><br>
<b>3.</b> <font color="#AF7AC5">Which is your favorite place in the world and why?</font><br><i>My favorite place in the world is my hometown of Kuwait. I grew up there so it's my comfort zone.</i><br><br>
<b>4.</b> <font color="#AF7AC5">What's the thing that you love most about New York?</font><br><i>The thing I love most about New York is the endless opportunities that exist here. There is something here for everyone and I love that.</i><br><br>
<b>5.</b> <font color="#AF7AC5">Where do you see yourself in 5 years?</font><br><i>In 5 years, hopefully I will be getting started on building a name for myself and starting my own design studio in Kuwait.</i><br><br></font>
